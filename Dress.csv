0;Love love love this dress. We went on a trip to Venice and it was the perfect dress. Everyone commented on it, and a few people with a camera kept following us everywhere we went to Piazza San Marco and took pictures of me. It is the perfect summer dress. Mine was showing no cleavage. I am 18 weeks pregnant so I ordered a Large, but probably a Medium, even a Small would have worked, but I kept this one so I can grow into it. Most likely I will like in it this summer.
1;I call this my 'Garden Dress' because the light green print looks like a pretty garden. This is one of those dresses that is prettier in person. The colour and print are lovely and perfect for summer. The flowers on the light green dress are so vibrant. The fit is great as the elastic waist makes me look thinner and the bottom part has volume and flow. I felt confident and pretty after wearing this and received compliments for the dress. The material is light and so soft. There are buttons from top to bottom that I had to close individually but once it was done, I could easily slip the dress over my head. As per fit, I ordered a small and it was true to fit. I am usually a size small in most brands. I am 5'3 and the length of this dress is perfect for me even with flat footwear. So, no alterations required. It is a good choice for a summer party or attending a wedding.
2;I love this dress. I bought it in the blue green colour first and I loved it so much. I bought the beige as well. It is very flowy and light which makes it comfortable to wear even in the Florida summer hear. I am 5'7 and the length is perfect. I am a size 12 and normally wear a large but I ordered this dress in an extra large since people said it runs smals and it fits pretty perfectly. I also noticed that as you wear it the material seems to slightly stretch out, it doesn't look baggy but just fits a little looser in my arms and bust area. I have bigger arms and usually have issues with sleeves that aren't stretchy fabric, but I was pleasantly suprised this fits in the arms comfortably. Hope this helps.
3;I bought this dress to wear to curch on Easter Sunday and received so many compliments. I also wore it to a Ladies Tea and it was perfect. Looked great with my hat and gloves and again got many compliments. It fit better than I expected as I am 5'3" and 180 lbs, but it is high waisted on me and that looked good. It was also a bit long, but I expected that. The material is soft and comfortable. It did take a while to button all the little buttons up the front and on the sleeves, but it was worth it. There was a lot of wrinkling and a slight odor when I received it but I washed it in cold water, hung it to dry and it was fine - no shrinking, no wrinkles. I really love this dress.
4;Absolutely beautiful. It is very long. I am 5'3 and it reaches my ankles. Very flowing and falls perfectly. The only issue that I have are the buttons. I love that it has many buttons because it makes the dress look even sexier or flattering but the buttons are not all that functional due to their size. They are very small so I would not recommend unbuttoning all of the buttons. There is no need to because the dress slips over your head without using buttons. I purchased a medium and I just love the fit. It is not too tight around the chest area. I will be looking for more dresses from Milumia.
